# Simple Quiz Website

###

#### Project available at: http://quiz-website2021.herokuapp.com/.com/

I developed this website to practice and increase my programming skills. Biggest focus to backend which was created with Laravel.

User of this website can:
-Register/Login.
-Create, view, update, delete questions.
-Create, view, update, delete quizzes.
-Play quizzes that he or other user created.
-Check quiz results.


## During this project my tasks were:

### BackEnd:

-   Install Laravel with ui and auth.
-   Create question CRUD.
-   Create quiz CRUD.
-   Create quiz game engine.
-   Create automatic result storing in background logic in case an user leaves quiz unfinished (Redis is used for queues).
-   all information comes from DB.

#### FrontEnd:

-   Create simple, not-fancy user inferface using Boostrap.
-   Create quiz game deadline timer with vanilla JavaScript.
